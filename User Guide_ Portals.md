## User Guide
_This is an excerpt from a User Guide to Interdimensional Portal Travel. It was inspired by the  Meow Wolf art collective’s interactive art installation_ “Omega Mart.” _I used my photos of the exhibit, the Meow Wolf fan wiki, and my imagination to create this mock user guide. The “signs of portal sickness” are from a poster in Omega Mart. I borrowed the name Nimsesku from an interdimensional hamster in a different Meow Wolf exhibit. Everything else is my own work. The audience for this user guide is interdimensional travelers who are familiar with forkles and nimseskus._


### Welcome
Congratulations on your Portal purchase! Interdimensional Portals are one of the most efficient ways to travel throughout the Multiverse. In this User Guide, we cover best practices to make your Portal travel as safe as possible, as well as common side effects of Portal travel. This user guide does not cover choosing dimensional destinations or how to address Portal sickness.


### Portal installation and repair
Only a certified technician can install or repair Interdimensional Portals. Do **NOT** attempt installation or repair by yourself. If the Portal is not working, call the Portal Repair Number. You can find it posted inside the Portal, directly below the keypad. You may also send a message by forkle if the network is operational.


### Preparing to tune your Portal
Before using the Portal for the first time, you need to tune it to your electricity signature and unique genetic makeup. To perform this procedure, you need an Interdimensional Portal address (IP address) in a dimension other than your current one. Ask a friend or relative if you may use their address for your Portal test. Many Portal vendors offer their addresses for this purpose. If you want to use a Portal vendor for your test, click on [this list of participating vendors](https://meow-wolf.fandom.com/wiki/Meow_Wolf_Wiki:Omega_Mart). Once you have the address, collect the following items: 
* A cotton swab
* An animal like a nimsesku
* A piece of cheddar cheese about as big as a human thumb


### Tuning your Portal
First, send a message to your exo-dimensional contact. Tell them you are starting the test and they need to look for the arrival of your nimsesku. Ask them to contact you when the nimsesku arrives. Don’t worry about the health of your nimsesku. These animals are perfect for Portal tunings because they can carry DNA through Portals. They frequently travel interdimensionally without harm.

Next, give the cheese to the nimsesku. While it is nibbling, collect your saliva and DNA by rubbing the inside of your cheek with the cotton swab for about 20 seconds. Pick up the nimsesku, and rub the end of the swab gently over the nimsesku’s fur. 

Now that you have prepared the nimsesku, ready the Portal for the test. Open the doors using the elbow scanner. Hold the nimsesku and the remaining cheese in one hand, and enter the IP address on the keypad inside the doors. Then release the nimsesku inside the Portal and exit before the doors close. The average closing time on Portal doors is about 12 seconds. Wait for the message from your contact telling you that the nimsesku arrived. Once you receive this message, it is safe to use the Portal. If you do not receive a message, do **NOT** try to use the Portal. Conduct another tuning and if that also fails, call your local Portal technician for help. 

### Portal sickness
Frequent Portal travel (more than once a week) can cause side effects ranging from annoying to serious. Some people are prone to Portal sickness even if they travel once a month or less. Watch out for these signs of Portal sickness:
* Dream bleeding
* Sharp blood syndrome
* Cosmic dizziness
* Quantum collapsation
* Dissociative hunger

If you experience any of these symptoms, call your doctor right away.
