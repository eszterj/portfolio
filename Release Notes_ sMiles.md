# Release Notes
_sMiles is a real app that I use almost every day. I invented a new version of the app for these mock release notes. “Stack sats, friends” is a quote from the sMiles website. Everything else is my own work._

## Welcome
Welcome to the newest version of **sMiles for Android**, the app that rewards you with bitcoin for things you do every day. We have some big changes in this version, and the one we’re most excited about is something many of you have asked for: sats for cycling! Keep reading for all the details.

## To get the newest version
If you have the “update automatically” option turned on, you don’t have to do anything. If you like to update your apps manually, you’ll need to visit the Play Store and follow these steps: 
1. Find the heading under your profile called “Manage apps and device.” 
2. Continue to “Updates available.”
3. Choose either “Update all” and finish there, OR
4. Select “See details.” 
5. Scroll down to find sMiles.
6. Hit the “Update” button next to the app.

You can also search for the app in the search bar. When you find it, there will be a green “Update” button on the landing page. Clicking that button will get you the newest version.

## What’s changed
So many of you have requested it, and we’re excited to tell you that it’s **_finally_** here: you can now connect sMiles to your Strava app! Currently, we’re able to reward users for cycling only. All seven types of cycling in the Strava app are eligible for rewards up to 65 miles. To enable this feature, go to the Settings menu and find the new heading “Connect with Strava.” Click it and follow the instructions on your screen. Once you’ve linked sMiles with Strava, your cycling activity will be automatically imported just like your step count. We also revamped the rewards in the Fortune Wheel, so head to the Offers section to check it out. 

## Bug fixes
Our developers have been working hard behind the scenes! We squashed the bug that some users experienced in syncing activity with Google Fit, enabling sMiles to connect more seamlessly and get your sats to you faster. You’ll notice this on the “Activity” page–the white step indicators turn blue much faster. We also tackled the bug that allowed some users to rack up unrealistic step numbers by putting their phones in rocking devices when they weren’t walking.
