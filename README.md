technical writing resume and portfolio

The world is a confusing place. I want to make it clearer, one word at a time. I’m excited to be starting my technical writing career with strong communication skills from my previous field. I believe in staying curious, in embracing learning, and in solving problems collaboratively. My beginner’s mindset, my empathy, and my love of clear communication help me create documentation with the user at its heart.
